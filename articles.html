    <h1> Your Online Spaces Belong to You. </h1>
    <h2> Childish contrarianism is good and a core tenet to my ideology. </h2>
    <p>
    The Internet has made rapid innovations in the past decade and a half, with the invention of smartphones, tablets, and other devices that allow the technologically inept to access the World Wide Web. This of course, is a terrible thing. There is no just reason I should be on the same servers and have to interact with untouchables in India, its a disaster on all fronts. As a white American, the fact I have to share my spaces with Mexicans deeply bothers me. <br><br> To circumvent the spiritual poisoning of libtards and swarthoids from entering my mind, I seek more and more extreme and obscure communities. I have been a digital nomad for most of my life, bouncing between forums, YouTube communities and image boards. In 2014 I had a significant period of time where I settled to 4chan and 8chan following the events of gamergate, which captivated my elementary school self. The abrasiveness and bitterness these communities held alongside intelligent discussion made me fall in love with the chans. I stayed on there until around 2018, close to the point of the Reiko controversy. Seeing how bad the troonification of the site became I fled, seeking obscure imageboards like Lainchan, or the Systemspace boards. <br><br> What Ive come to realize in this experience is that content does not affect trannys views towards a platform. 4chan has definitely been a very hateful place to these perverts, but they still stayed, subverting the people themselves, running grooming discord servers, and making every post coal. Comedy or coherent ideas are not the main priority to those who need to hide from their human form, scared of their genetics. <br><br> To these superficial peoples, one thing matters: aesthetics. Those who cannot properly maintain the aesthetics of their body seek a digital style in what they enjoy. This is why old styled websites are filled with these people, they need to escape reality, so they seek the most exaggerated, superficial form of the old Internet. They will never have this old Internet, since the ideas it was founded upon by technically advanced white men are frowned upon and censored in these spaces, so they are instead stuck with modernity with a retro coat of paint. <br><br> This dichotomy between those with the understanding of genuine online values (wanting a free and open internet vs. trannies seeking moderating janny positions) and those who only seek its appearance has created a system of the proliferation of online ideas. Firstly: content will be praised, created or shared in a pure online circle, whether this be an incel, rw, or trolling community. This content will have an expressed meaning behind it, as a way to explain a piece of the creators worldview. Chad for example was a name coined to represent those enviable with their high social status and ability to attract women. Now, he has become "The right answer guy", where he restates the thing the norwood leftist creator believes, but since he is attractive, he is right. This is almost antithetical to the original point of this creation. This is because mainstream people struggle to understand themes. <br><br> Recently with some friends of mine, we decided to watch a film. I requested we saw Taxi Driver as I knew I would enjoy it and I havent seen it before.  We sat through the film and I definitely enjoyed it, it was satisfying how it all tied up, deserves its spot in IMDBs top 100 films list. My friends however, did not feel the same. They said it didnt make any sense and that they wished it was a more linear simple story. A normie brain cannot understand art I dont think, they have been poisoned by ZOGfilms such as those produced by Marvel or Disney, with artificial feeling conflict to portray a simple message or theme. If your message in your long-form work of art can be explained properly in 5 or less words, your product sucks, but will probably appeal to a wide audience. <br><br> With people like this on the same Internet I am, it makes it very difficult to find communities free from it, especially because communities of creative, transgressive people will all be colonized by the mindless drones or those who seek the aesthetics. Take the anime community. Ask a tranny what their favorite anime is: Evangelion, Lain, Azumanga, etc. These are all great works of art, I thoroughly enjoy every single one of these, they are my favorites as well. The difference comes in why I enjoy them. I enjoy their stories, their messages, them as pieces of art, these people enjoy them because they are oldnigger anime and that they have cool aesthetics. Eva "fans" will sit through the entire show and only get "Asuka is the angry one, Rei is the quiet one, Misato is the mommy dom character that people online want to have sex with." They dont understand it, they genuinely dont have an IQ high enough to extract messaging from a show as they watch it. They will substitute this will explanation videos, which examine all media from a Marxist perspective. Evangelion or Attack on Titan are not leftist pieces of media, people just cant recognize themes that havent already been presented to them by Disney. <br><br> These people are poisonous to all forms of discussion, and should be avoided at all costs. Be abrasive, say nigger in every piece of original content you make, it will delay the inevitable. <br><br> Addendum: For examples on what Im speaking of in regards to normoids taking things from circles of online people and watering it down to its least offensive and most boring extent: look through these posts, and the disavowing comments on the greentext. All forms of transgressive edgy content against their worldview is suddenly not fun anymore. <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/Hm_Spooky/status/1574963363301380096" target="_blank" style = "color: blue"> Soyjak Gentrification </a> <br> <a href="https://twitter.com/GreenTextRepost/status/1574493421699571712" target="_blank" style = "color: blue"> All Greentexts must be about wholesome gay sex or trannies </a>

    <h1> The Troon, The Internet, and the Future: </h1>
    <p> 
      My entire life I have been an edrama-fag for the post-gamergate crowd. That group captivated me heavily in my childhood, watching the Internet Aristocrat when I was an elementary schooler. Being exposed to such was probably the turning point at which I went too far too soon in online development, where I would slowly continue to further indulge myself in a purely virtual world. I was never a bully victim or was alienated from my peers, I just always saw a disconnect, which grew larger and larger as I got older. I acted very eccentrically, telling my elementary school peers about the online happenings in the 2012-2014 gaming/ anime communities, and how I was a brony. Even among "online people" that I would know from school, I didnt think like them, I found no common ground. They were all faggots: homosexuals, genderfluid, those types. It was weird how preference in online content had such a profound impact on our worldview. There was no sense of unity in eccentricity, it was almost as if they perceived me as an enemy.<br><br>This combative relationship has only grown in this time. A real power shift has happened in these past 8 years. Free speech is not an issue being combatted by "soccer moms" trying to ban violent video games, now we all are forced to suffer under the reign of a cabal of bitter eunuchs who need the entire world to change for them to feel validated. The transgender community is probably the most depraved circle of people that arent overtly criminal (in a just society these actions would be criminal but we dont live in one of those). A troon will get a sex change operation due to their sick paraphilias demanding it, only to have the castration dull their sex drive to such an extent they are either met with suicidal dread or a sick need for stronger sexual stimuli.<br><br>The transgender is one who has experienced social isolation and possibly some sort of social trauma. This manifests in the troon with a deep hatred of people, especially women Ive noticed. I brought up gamergate at the beginning of this writing because I wanted a decent way to portray that I had a view on the Keffals/ Kiwi Farms situation. The drama itself and its people are less important to me than what everything in this situation represents.  Keffals is the platonic ideal of a troon, the perfect encapsulation of everything it stands for. A child groomer sex pest and a raging misogynist who gets off to the destruction of pure femininity. Keffals has been quoted to say that he doesnt want to be a woman, he wants to be better than a woman. His methods of sending dog collars to children with his name on it and making dominatrix pornography is a very odd method to do this I believe. However I think our views on what a woman is is highly varied. Troons view women in a very bimboified way, as sexual objects almost. I am not a feminist, I am fairly traditional in the way I view gender relationships, but the transgender movement has given me a large amount of sympathy for the "TERF" movement. Trannyism is an online fringe movement that somehow made it out into the real world in a powerful way, like if a video game villain came out of my tv screen and said Id be a bigot if I didnt give oral to his artificial clit. Trannyism is not a freedom movement for anything serious or genuine, trans rights dont exist, they arent even supposed to. These people have infiltrated all other rights movements to secure institutional protection for their actions. What are these actions? Grooming minors into life altering surgery that will ruin their lives. <br><br>The most contentious tranny issue would be hormone blockers for minors, just in case they want to be a girl. This is a highly dangerous idea, but they dont really care how messing with our childrens internal chemicals would have consequences. They just want people to be weak, feminine, and insecure so that they have a better ability to groom them into their suicide cult. Trannys prey on insecure children who dont feel fully comfortable with their social status. I brought up my social status at the beginning of this in a way to preface this: when I was young I was preyed on by these people. Not very directly, but their ideas seen on sites such as 4chan have given me grief and uncertainty for something that I would have never considered otherwise. I will never be a troon, but through my younger years I definitely struggled with it. Now that I understand how this community reproduces, I understand that you cant negotiate with these people, you need to protect yourself and your loved ones from this insidious group of pederast perverts.<br><br>We need to drive these people away from online spaces, we need to cast them out and have people understand how destructive they are. Although Im pessimistic about this. I think we lost this. No easier way to see that is the untimely shutdown of kiwi farms. The internet I grew up on is going away, freedom of speech and anonymity online are going away soon. Our online experience is now completely in line with a select set of private corporations, government entities and elite individuals. The elements of transgenderism such as castration and loss of personal identity are things that benefit our global elite. Due to this, we are on the losing side of resources. This in conjunction to the increasingly unified internet we are entering, troons will continue to breed and do as they please unless dramatic action is taken. Kiwi Farms shutdown is just the beginning of the end, it wont stop here, until every chuddy or even feminine space is removed or subverted. I was never a Kiwi Farms user, however this conflict has given me a deep respect for Josh Moon. His Web 1.0 kind is a dying breed so Im willing to support him as the best thing we have at the moment.<br><br>I apologize for the fragmented and tangent-filled structure of this writing. I wrote this during my Diff Eq and Physics classes and I had to go between there and home during the writing, leading to ideas being all over the place, future articles will be better written I hope.
